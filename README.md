# Android Transformer

![Logo](assets/logo.png)

Android Transformer It's Java library to manage your object transformations between your POJO objects.

## Version

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/txusballesteros/maven/android-transformer/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/txusballesteros/maven/android-transformer/_latestVersion) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Android%20Transformer-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1455)

## How to use

Add the library dependency to your build.gradle file.
```java
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.mobandme:android-transformer:1.1.1'
    provided 'com.mobandme:android-transformer-compiler:1.1.1'
}
```

If you are using any other libraries with AnnotationsProcessors like ButterKnife, Realm, etc... You need to set this in your build.gradle to exclude the Processor that is already packaged:
```groovy
packagingOptions {
    exclude 'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'
}
```

Use @Mappable annotation on your class definitions and @Mapped on the fields that you want map to the destination object. See that you destination object type
is defined by the 'with' configuration on @Mappable annotation.

IMPORTANT, You don't need configure nothing on your destination classes because the library made this job to you.

```java
@Mappable( with = Home.class )
class HomeModel {

    @Mapped
    public String Address;
    
    // If your objects does not contains the same names into their fields,
    // you can configure the destiny name using the 'toField' parameter.
    @Mapped ( toField = "PostalCode")
    public String CityCode;
    ...

}
```

```java
class Home {

    public String Address;
    
    public String PostalCode;
    ...

}
```
And now you will can make your object conversion.

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    
    private void MyMethod(HomeModel model) {
        //Build your Class transformer.
        Transformer homeModelTransformer = new Transformer
                                                    .Builder()
                                                        .build(HomeModel.class);

        ...
        
        //Converting your Model objects to your Domain objects.
        Home home = (Home)homeModelTransformer.transform(model);
        
        //If you don't like castings between your objects, you can use this.
        Home home = homeModelTransformer.transform(model, Home.class);
        
        ...
        
        //Converting your Domain objects to your Model objects.
        HomeModel homeModel = (HomeModel)homeModelTransformer.transform(home);
        
        //If you don't like castings between your objects, you can use this.
        HomeModel homeModel = homeModelTransformer.transform(home, HomeModel.class);
        ...
    }
}
```
## Using Custom Parsers

Imagine that you need make complex conversions between your objects, for example, you have a entity 
on your model with a field of String type, and on the other hand you have a Calendar type field on your Domain objects. Now, you can
 configure your customs data parsers and personalize this conversions.
 
First, create your custom data parsers, IMPORTANT, you need the in-out data parsers, I mean, if you want
convert a String to a Calendar, you need a parser to convert Calendar to String.

```java
public class CalendarToStringParser extends AbstractParser<Calendar, String> {
    
    @Override
    protected String onParse(Calendar value) {
        SimpleDateFormat dateFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
        return dateFormatter.format(value.getTime());
    }
}
```

```java
public class StringToCalendarParser extends AbstractParser<String, Calendar> {
    @Override
    protected Calendar onParse(String value) {
        Calendar calendar = GregorianCalendar.getInstance();

        try {
            SimpleDateFormat dateFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
            calendar.setTime(dateFormatter.parse(value));
        } catch (ParseException e) { }

        return calendar;
    }
}
```

Now, you need configure this parsers into your fields.

```java
@Mappable( with = Home.class )
public class HomeModel {

    ...
    
    @Parse(
        originToDestinationWith = CalendarToStringParser.class,
        destinationToOriginWith = StringToCalendarParser.class
    )
    @Mapped public Calendar Date;
    
    ...
    
}
```
